# Data Analysis Python Library
A repository of user defined functions I wrote (and some other codes I use frequently) for data preprocessing in data science projects that handle big data. 

The stages of data preprocessing covered includes: 
1. File Processing
2. Dataframe Formatting
3. EDA
4. Data wranggling & transformations for machine learning 
5. Data Analysis & Visualizations
6. One Map Api (get postal code)
