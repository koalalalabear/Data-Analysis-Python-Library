# Data Analysis Python Library
A repository of functions and codes I wrote and intend to re-use in data preprocessing for data science projects that handle big data. 

The stages of data preprocessing covered includes: 
1. File Processing
2. Data Frame Formatting
3. EDA
4. Data wranggling & transformations for machine learning 
5. Data Analysis & Visualizations
6. One Map Api (get postal code)
